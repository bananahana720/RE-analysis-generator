# ADR-001: Repository Pattern vs Direct Database Access

## Status
**ACCEPTED** - Implemented in Epic 1 Foundation Infrastructure

## Context
The Phoenix Real Estate Data Collection System requires a data persistence layer that can handle property data storage, retrieval, and querying across multiple epics. The system must:

- Support MongoDB Atlas free tier (512MB limit)
- Enable testable abstractions for unit testing
- Provide consistent data access patterns across Epic 2 (Collection) and Epic 3 (Automation)
- Allow for future database migrations or multi-database support
- Maintain clear separation between business logic and data persistence

Two primary approaches were considered:

### Option 1: Direct Database Access
- Components directly interact with MongoDB client
- Simpler initial implementation
- Direct control over database operations
- Minimal abstraction overhead

### Option 2: Repository Pattern
- Abstract data access behind repository interfaces
- Standardized CRUD operations across all data types
- Testable through mock implementations
- Consistent error handling and logging
- Clear separation of concerns

## Decision
**We will implement the Repository Pattern** as the primary data access abstraction.

The system will use a layered approach:
```
Epic 2/3 Business Logic → PropertyRepository Interface → MongoDB Implementation
```

### Key Interface Definition
```python
class PropertyRepository(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def create(self, property_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> str
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def get_by_id(self, property_id: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def update(self, property_id: str, updates: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def search_by_zipcode(self, zipcode: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]
```

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
1. **Testability**: Epic 2 and Epic 3 components can be unit tested with mock repositories
2. **Consistency**: All data access follows the same patterns and error handling
3. **Abstraction**: Business logic is decoupled from MongoDB implementation details
4. **Future-Proofing**: Database migrations or multi-database support is possible
5. **Error Handling**: Centralized database error handling and logging
6. **Configuration Integration**: Repository uses Epic 1's ConfigProvider for connection settings

### Negative Consequences
1. **Complexity**: Additional abstraction layer adds some complexity
2. **Performance**: Minor overhead from interface abstraction (< 1ms per operation)
3. **Learning Curve**: Developers must understand repository pattern implementation

### Implementation Impact on Other Epics

#### Epic 2: Data Collection Engine
- **Benefit**: Collectors can focus on data gathering logic without database concerns
- **Usage**: `await self.repository.create(property_data)` for data storage
- **Testing**: Mock repositories enable isolated testing of collection logic

#### Epic 3: Automation & Orchestration
- **Benefit**: Orchestration logic is independent of database implementation
- **Usage**: Report generation queries through repository interface
- **Testing**: Automated workflows can be tested without database dependencies

#### Epic 4: Quality Assurance
- **Benefit**: Repository interface provides consistent patterns for validation
- **Usage**: Quality checks can validate repository operations through interface
- **Testing**: QA tests can verify repository contract compliance

### Alternative Considered: Direct Access
Direct database access was rejected because:
- Testing Epic 2 collectors would require real database connections
- Epic 3 orchestration would be tightly coupled to MongoDB specifics
- Inconsistent error handling across different database operations
- Difficult to implement cross-cutting concerns like logging and metrics

### Risk Mitigation
- **Performance**: Repository operations are async and use connection pooling
- **Complexity**: Clear documentation and examples in Epic 1 foundation
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite validates repository contract compliance

## Implementation Guidelines

### Epic 1 Foundation Responsibilities
- Define PropertyRepository interface with complete type hints
- Implement MongoDBPropertyRepository with all CRUD operations
- Provide MockPropertyRepository for testing
- Handle connection management, error handling, and logging

### Epic 2 Collection Integration
- All collectors must use repository interface exclusively
- No direct MongoDB client usage in collection components
- Adapter pattern converts external data to repository-compatible format

### Epic 3 Automation Integration
- Orchestration engine uses repository for data access
- Report generation queries through repository interface
- No duplicate data access patterns outside repository

### Epic 4 Quality Validation
- Validate repository operations follow interface contract
- Test repository performance and error handling
- Monitor repository usage patterns and optimization opportunities

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] All database operations go through PropertyRepository interface
- [ ] Epic 2 collectors successfully use repository for data storage
- [ ] Epic 3 orchestration accesses data only through repository
- [ ] Unit tests use mock repositories exclusively
- [ ] Repository implementation handles all MongoDB Atlas requirements
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show < 1ms interface overhead
