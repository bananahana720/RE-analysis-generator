# RA-1 Research Findings: Real Estate Data Sources & APIs

## Executive Summary
After comprehensive research into automated real estate data collection methods, I've identified a hybrid approach combining official APIs, MLS aggregators, and public records as the optimal solution. Direct web scraping, while technically feasible, carries significant legal risks that make it unsuitable for production systems.

## Official Real Estate APIs

### Zillow API
- **Status**: Invite-only, highly restricted
- **Coverage**: Most comprehensive when available
- **Cost**: Variable, typically $500+/month
- **Pros**: Best data quality, real-time updates
- **Cons**: Difficult to obtain access, expensive

### Redfin Data
- **Status**: Free downloadable datasets
- **Coverage**: Major US markets
- **Cost**: Free
- **Pros**: No cost, good coverage, regular updates
- **Cons**: Not real-time, no API, limited to Redfin markets

### Realtor.com
- **Status**: Partnership-based access only
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive US coverage
- **Cost**: Negotiated partnerships
- **Pros**: Extensive listings
- **Cons**: No public API

## MLS Integration Options

### Direct MLS Access
- Requires real estate licensing
- Complex integration with multiple MLS systems
- Most comprehensive data available
- High barrier to entry

### MLS Aggregators (Recommended)
1. **SimplyRETS**
   - Unified API across multiple MLS systems
   - RESTful modern API design
   - $300-500/month
   - Good documentation and support

2. **Realtyna**
   - WordPress plugin options
   - API and data feed access
   - Similar pricing to SimplyRETS
   - Good for web integration

## Web Scraping Technologies

### Python Frameworks
1. **BeautifulSoup**
   - Best for: Simple, static websites
   - Learning curve: Low
   - Performance: Moderate

2. **Scrapy**
   - Best for: Large-scale operations
   - Learning curve: Moderate
   - Performance: High
   - Built-in rate limiting and error handling

3. **Selenium/Playwright**
   - Best for: JavaScript-heavy sites
   - Learning curve: Moderate to high
   - Performance: Lower (browser overhead)
   - Can handle dynamic content

### Legal Considerations
- Major platforms explicitly prohibit scraping
- Risk of IP blocking and legal action
- Rate limiting essential (minimum 1 req/sec)
- Always check robots.txt

## OCR Solutions

### Google Cloud Vision API
- **Accuracy**: 98% for printed text
- **Cost**: $1.50 per 1000 pages
- **Pros**: Highest accuracy, handles complex layouts
- **Cons**: Requires internet connection, ongoing costs

### Tesseract (Open Source)
- **Accuracy**: 90-95% for clean images
- **Cost**: Free
- **Pros**: No ongoing costs, works offline
- **Cons**: Lower accuracy, requires preprocessing

### Hybrid Approach
- Use Tesseract for initial processing
- Fall back to Cloud Vision for difficult cases
- Implement image preprocessing pipeline
- Cache results to minimize API calls

## Alternative Data Sources

### Public Records APIs
1. **ATTOM Data**
   - 150+ million property records
   - Tax assessments, deeds, mortgages
   - ~$0.10 per property lookup
   - REST API with good documentation

2. **TaxNetUSA**
   - County tax data
   - Ownership information
   - Subscription-based pricing

3. **PropMix**
   - Property characteristics
   - Ownership data
   - API access available

### Government Sources
- County assessor websites
- Often free but require individual integration
- Data quality varies by county
- Consider building scrapers for key counties

## Implementation Recommendations

### For Startups (Budget < $500/month)
1. Start with Redfin free data downloads
2. Use Tesseract for OCR needs
3. Integrate free government sources
4. Build careful web scrapers for public data

### For Growth Stage ($500-2000/month)
1. SimplyRETS or Realtyna for MLS access
2. ATTOM Data for enrichment
3. Google Cloud Vision for OCR
4. Automated data quality checks

### For Enterprise ($2000+/month)
1. Direct MLS partnerships
2. Multiple data source redundancy
3. Custom API negotiations
4. Dedicated infrastructure

## Data Quality Considerations

### Validation Strategy
- Cross-reference multiple sources
- Implement confidence scoring
- Flag anomalies for review
- Regular accuracy audits

### Handling Inconsistencies
- Standardize address formats
- Normalize price representations
- Deduplicate listings
- Version control for updates

## Conclusion

The optimal approach combines legitimate API access through MLS aggregators with public records enrichment. While web scraping is technically feasible, the legal risks make it unsuitable for production systems. Starting with SimplyRETS or similar aggregators provides the best balance of cost, coverage, and compliance for most use cases. Supplement with public records APIs for additional data depth, and reserve OCR solutions for cases where structured data isn't available.
