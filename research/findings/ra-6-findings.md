**Database**: PostgreSQL (structured) + MongoDB (unstructured)
- PostgreSQL for relational property data
- MongoDB for flexible document storage

**Additional Components**:
- Redis for caching frequently accessed data
- REST APIs with JSON responses
- Python libraries for data processing and analysis

### For Real-Time Data Collection
**Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- Excellent for handling concurrent connections
- Unified JavaScript across the stack
- Efficient real-time data processing

**Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- Choice depends on data structure requirements
- Consider hybrid approach for mixed data types

**Real-Time Features**:
- WebSockets for live updates
- Redis for performance optimization
- Event-driven architecture

### Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
Leverage strengths of both ecosystems:
- **Python**: Data processing, analysis, ML tasks
- **Node.js**: Real-time API endpoints, web server
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for structured data
- **Redis**: Caching layer for performance
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployment

## Practical Recommendations

1. **Start with MLS IDX**: At $49-99/month, MLS feeds offer the best cost-to-quality ratio
2. **Implement Fallback Strategies**: Combine multiple data sources to ensure reliability
3. **Consider Hybrid Solutions**: Use APIs for real-time data, scraping for historical analysis
4. **Prioritize Compliance**: Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance and respect robots.txt
5. **Plan for Scale**: Design architecture to handle growth from day one
6. **Monitor API Costs**: Implement usage tracking to prevent unexpected charges

## Conclusion

The 2025 real estate data collection landscape offers mature solutions for every budget and technical requirement. While premium APIs provide reliability and compliance, open-source tools and commercial scrapers offer cost-effective alternatives. The key to success lies in choosing the right combination of tools based on specific project requirements, budget constraints, and scalability needs.
