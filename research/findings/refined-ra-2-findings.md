# Cost-Optimized Real Estate Data Collection System: 2025 Infrastructure Analysis

## Executive Summary

Building a daily automated real estate data collection system in 2025 with a $25/month budget is not only feasible but has become significantly more accessible thanks to advances in local LLMs, free orchestration tools, and budget-friendly proxy services. This research outlines a practical architecture leveraging modern open-source tools and minimal infrastructure to create a robust, privacy-focused solution.

## Local LLM Solutions for Data Extraction

The landscape of local LLM data extraction has matured significantly in 2025. The release of LLM 0.23 introduced schema-based structured output, enabling local models to extract data into predefined formats reliably. For real estate data extraction, several options stand out:

**LLM-AIx** provides a web-based interface for structured information extraction, supporting all models compatible with llama-cpp in gguf format. This tool is particularly valuable for extracting property details from listings, converting unstructured HTML into structured JSON or CSV formats.

**Gemini Flash 2.0** offers exceptional value for OCR tasks, processing 6000 pages for just $1, though this is cloud-based. For purely local processing, **LLaMA** models can handle PDFs, documents, and scanned files reasonably well, though complex layouts may require additional preprocessing.

The key advantage of local LLMs for real estate data is privacy and cost predictability. Once deployed, there are no per-request charges, making high-volume daily scraping economically viable.

## Free Workflow Orchestration Solutions

For daily automation without server costs, **GitHub Actions** emerges as the ideal solution. It's completely free for public repositories and provides 2000 minutes/month for private repos. Using cron schedules like `0 0 * * *`, you can trigger daily workflows that orchestrate your entire data collection pipeline.

For more complex workflows, **Apache Airflow** remains the gold standard in open-source orchestration, though it requires self-hosting. Alternatively, **Kestra** has gained significant momentum in 2024-2025 with its declarative YAML-based workflows and real-time event triggers, making it excellent for reactive scraping based on new listings.

**n8n** offers a visual workflow builder that's particularly user-friendly for non-developers, while **Prefect** provides Python-native orchestration with minimal code changes required.

## NoSQL Database Solutions

For storing semi-structured real estate data, several free options excel:

**MongoDB Atlas** offers a generous free tier perfect for personal projects, with no predefined schemas needed - ideal for heterogeneous real estate data where different sites provide different fields. The MongoDB Query Language (MQL) is JavaScript-like and beginner-friendly.

**Redis** provides blazing-fast in-memory storage, perfect for caching recent listings and deduplication. Its support for various data structures makes it excellent for maintaining scraping state and temporary data.

For simpler needs, **Turso** (SQLite-based) has been highly recommended in 2025 for its generous free tier and ease of use. While technically not NoSQL, its flexibility makes it suitable for semi-structured data.

## Budget Proxy Services Under $25/Month

Proxy rotation is crucial for reliable real estate scraping. The most cost-effective options in 2025 include:

**Webshare** stands out with plans starting at just $1/month for 10 rotating datacenter proxies with unmetered bandwidth. Their forever-free tier provides basic rotation capabilities sufficient for small-scale projects.

**Proxy-Cheap** lives up to its name with datacenter proxies at $0.30 per IP/month and residential proxies starting at $2.99 for rotating pools. With coverage in over 180 countries, it's ideal for scraping international real estate markets.

For those needing residential proxies specifically, **IPRoyal** offers pay-as-you-go options perfect for variable workloads, while **Rayobyte** provides competitive rates at $5.25/GB for residential IPs.

## Container-Based Architecture

Docker Compose enables consistent, portable deployments. Several real estate projects demonstrate this approach:

The **wohnung-scraper** project showcases a complete dockerized solution for German real estate sites, including visualization. The **real-estate-monitoring** project combines scraping with TimescaleDB and Superset, all orchestrated through docker-compose.

A typical docker-compose.yml would include:
- Scraper service with local LLM
- Redis for caching and deduplication  
- MongoDB/Turso for persistent storage
- Nginx for optional web interface

## Implementation Architecture

The recommended minimal infrastructure pattern:

1. **GitHub Repository**: Hosts code and GitHub Actions workflows
2. **Daily GitHub Action**: Triggers at midnight UTC, spins up containers
3. **Docker Compose Stack**:
   - Python scraper with BeautifulSoup/Playwright
   - Local LLM service for data extraction
   - Redis for state management
   - MongoDB Atlas (free tier) for storage
4. **Proxy Rotation**: Webshare's $1/month plan integrated into scraper
5. **Results**: Data pushed to MongoDB, optional notifications via GitHub Actions

Total monthly cost: $1 (Webshare) + $0 (everything else) = **$1/month**

This architecture provides a robust, scalable foundation that can grow with your needs while maintaining minimal costs and maximum privacy through local processing.
