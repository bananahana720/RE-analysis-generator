## Financial Analysis Metrics

### Core Investment Calculations

#### Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate)
```python
def calculate_cap_rate(net_operating_income, property_value):
    """
    Cap Rate = (NOI / Property Value) × 100
    Good cap rates: 4-10% depending on market
    """
    return (net_operating_income / property_value) * 100
```

#### Cash-on-Cash Return
```python
def cash_on_cash_return(annual_cash_flow, initial_cash_investment):
    """
    Measures the return on actual cash invested
    Target: 8-12% for residential rentals
    """
    return (annual_cash_flow / initial_cash_investment) * 100
```

#### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
- Considers time value of money
- Includes appreciation and cash flows
- More comprehensive than cap rate
- Target: 15-20% for fix-and-flip

#### 1% Rule Evaluation
- Monthly rent should be ≥1% of purchase price
- Quick screening tool
- Market-dependent validity

### Advanced Financial Modeling

#### Monte Carlo Simulation
```python
def monte_carlo_property_analysis(property_data, iterations=10000):
    """
    Simulate various scenarios for:
    - Rent growth (2-5% annually)
    - Expense inflation (2-4%)
    - Vacancy rates (5-10%)
    - Interest rate changes
    """
    # Returns probability distributions of returns
```
