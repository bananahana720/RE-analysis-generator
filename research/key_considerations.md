# Real Estate Data Collection Project Plan

## Project Overview
**Use Case:** Personal home buying research and analysis

## Research & Data Access Strategy

### Preferred Approach
- **API Access:** Preferred method for easier implementation
- **MLS Integration:** Investigate if MLS solutions exist and are accessible
- **Alternative Solutions:** Explore MCP servers, expert OCR LLM models, or scraping libraries that can bypass anti-scraping measures

### MLS Access Investigation
- **Cost Analysis:** Determine pricing and requirements for MLS access
- **Accessibility:** Research restrictions on public access
- **Feasibility:** Evaluate if MLS is a viable option for personal use

## Data Requirements

### Primary Data Sources
- **Recently Sold Properties:** Focus on houses sold within the last year (< 1 year)
- **Current Listings:** Active property listings with pricing and details

### Data Strategy
- **Limited Scope:** Start with minimal sources to reduce complexity
- **Database Structure:** Consider NoSQL database with general categories for easy analytics
- **Data Reliability:** Prioritize sources that provide reliable information

### Additional Data Points
- Price change tracking (append to original extracted price)
- Property listing duplicates and discrepancies
- Raw data collection first, then structured processing later

## Technical Architecture

### Execution Schedule
- **Frequency:** Daily automated runs
- **Scale:** Personal use only (not distributed product)

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Raw Data Collection:** Initial extraction and storage
2. **Data Cleansing:** Move processed data to cleansed tables (semi-structured or structured)
3. **Duplicate Handling:** Process same property listings downstream
4. **Discrepancy Detection:** Track and note property listing inconsistencies

### Storage Strategy
- **Decision Needed:** Require guidance on optimal storage solution
- **Considerations:** Cost, scalability, and query performance

## Scaling & Geographic Scope

### MVP Approach
- **Start Small:** Begin with limited geographic area
- **Target Location:** Phoenix, Arizona
- **Initial Scope:** 2-3 zip codes (manageable for MVP)
- **Scaling Plan:** Expand as needed after MVP validation

## Budget Constraints

### Cost Priorities
- **Free Options:** Prioritize free solutions where possible
- **Local LLM:** Use local LLM implementation (no proprietary LLM usage)
- **Budget Cap:** Maximum $25/month for manageable costs

### Infrastructure Costs
- **Proxy Solutions:** Custom proxy rotation or open-source/paid service options
- **Storage:** Cost-effective storage solution within budget

## Technical Implementation

### Anti-Detection Measures
- **Proxy Rotation:** Implement custom solution or use existing service
- **Scraping Protection:** Utilize libraries that can bypass anti-scraping measures

### Future Enhancements
- **Analysis Layer:** Defer advanced analytics until data collection is established
- **Scope Expansion:** Increase retrieval scope after MVP implementation

## Legal & Ethical Considerations

### Compliance Research
- **Terms of Service:** Investigate which sites prohibit scraping
- **Personal Use:** Project is for personal research only (no commercial use)
- **Data Sales:** No intention to sell data or commercialize product

### Content Usage
- **Transformative Use:** Data transformation for personal analysis
- **No Copyright Concerns:** Not using copyrighted images or descriptions

### Risk Mitigation
- **Gradual Implementation:** Slow and careful approach to avoid issues
- **Legal Review:** Monitor ToS compliance for selected sources

## Data Quality Management

### Handling Stale Data
- **Future Enhancement:** Address data freshness in later project phases
- **MVP Focus:** Concentrate on system design and basic implementation
- **Iterative Improvement:** Gradually improve data accuracy and freshness

## Next Steps

1. **Research Phase:** Investigate MLS access and alternative data sources
2. **Technical Planning:** Define storage strategy and infrastructure requirements
3. **MVP Development:** Start with 2-3 Phoenix zip codes
4. **Legal Review:** Verify compliance with target site terms of service
5. **Implementation:** Build data collection pipeline
6. **Testing & Iteration:** Validate approach and refine as needed
