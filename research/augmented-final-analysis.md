# Augmented Analysis: Personal Real Estate Data Collection System for Phoenix (2025)

## Executive Summary

Based on refined research incorporating your specific constraints, building a personal real estate data collection system for Phoenix home buying is not only feasible within a $25/month budget but can be implemented with minimal legal risk using a combination of free government APIs, innovative 2025 tools, and careful technical implementation. The recommended approach prioritizes **Maricopa County's free API** as the primary data source, supplemented by PhoenixMLSSearch.com and modern anti-detection tools when necessary.

## Recommended Architecture (Under $25/Month)

### Core Technology Stack
