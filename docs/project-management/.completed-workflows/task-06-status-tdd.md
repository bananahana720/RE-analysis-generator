# Task 6: LLM Data Processing - TDD Status Tracking

## Implementation Overview

**Current Status**: Ready to Implement (Dependencies Validated)  
**Target Completion**: 4-5 days (added caching/cost tasks)  
**TDD Approach**: Strict test-first development for all LLM processing components  
**Budget**: $19/month available for LLM costs

### Updated Architecture Based on Analysis
1. **Tiered LLM Strategy**: Ollama (free) → GPT-3.5 → GPT-4o-mini based on property value
2. **Redis Caching**: 30% cost reduction through response caching
3. **Cost Tracking**: Real-time budget monitoring with automatic fallback
4. **Phoenix-Specific Data**: HOA info, irrigation rights, solar details, pool types

### Key Milestones
1. **Foundation**: Multi-provider LLM setup (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic), mock implementations
2. **Cost Management**: Redis caching layer, budget tracking, tiered model selection
3. **Core Processing**: Property data extraction with Phoenix-specific fields
4. **Integration**: Pipeline with Epic 1 collectors, batch processing
5. **Production**: Performance optimization, monitoring, deployment

## Critical Updates from Deep Analysis

### Required Dependencies to Add
```toml
# pyproject.toml additions
[project]
dependencies = [
    # ... existing dependencies ...
    
    # LLM Processing (Task 6)
    "openai>=1.0.0",           # Primary LLM provider
    "anthropic>=0.15.0",       # Fallback provider
    "ollama>=0.4.0",           # Local LLM for low-value properties
    "tiktoken>=0.5.0",         # Token counting for cost control
    "instructor>=0.4.0",       # Structured output parsing
    
    # Cost Optimization
    "redis>=5.0.0",            # Response caching (30% savings)
    "httpx>=0.25.0",           # Better async HTTP client
]
```

### Phoenix-Specific Data Points to Extract
- **Flood Irrigation Rights**: 22,000 homes have valuable water rights ($200+/month savings)
- **HOA Information**: Name, monthly fees, restrictions (1/3 of Phoenix homes)
- **Solar Details**: Installed/owned/leased (impacts value significantly)
- **Pool Types**: Play pool vs diving pool vs spa combinations
- **Desert Landscaping %**: Water conservation metric
- **Cooling Systems**: Central AC, dual-zone, evaporative
- **Roof Types**: Tile vs shingle (50+ year lifespan difference)

### Budget Optimization Strategy
```python
# Daily budget: $0.63 ($19/month)
# Property processing tiers:
< $200k: Ollama (free, local)
$200k-$500k: GPT-3.5-turbo ($0.50/1M tokens)
> $500k: GPT-4o-mini ($0.15/1M tokens)

# With caching: ~3,000 properties/month capacity
```
