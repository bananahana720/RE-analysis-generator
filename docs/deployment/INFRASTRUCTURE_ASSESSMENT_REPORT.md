    K[Nginx Proxy] --> F
    K --> G
    K --> E
```

**Critical Dependencies**:
- **Tier 1**: MongoDB, Ollama (core data services)
- **Tier 2**: Prometheus, Grafana (monitoring core)
- **Tier 3**: AlertManager, Node Exporter (enhanced monitoring)
- **Tier 4**: Nginx, Loki (production enhancements)

### 2. Root Cause Analysis - Monitoring Failures

**Primary Issues Identified**:

1. **AlertManager Configuration Syntax Errors** (Critical)
   - Invalid YAML structure in `alertmanager.yml`
   - Fields `subject` and `body` not recognized in email_configs
   - Causing container restart loops

2. **Network Configuration Conflicts** (High)
   - Multiple Docker Compose files with different network names
   - Port conflicts between development and production configs

3. **Missing Dependencies** (Medium)
   - Some services depend on missing configuration files
   - Volume mount paths inconsistent across environments

4. **Resource Contention** (Low)
   - Multiple Prometheus instances on different ports
   - Potential resource competition

## Optimized Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation (Days 1-2)

**Priority**: Fix core monitoring services

#### 1.1 AlertManager Configuration Fix
```yaml
# Fixed alertmanager.yml structure
receivers:
  - name: 'critical-alerts'
    email_configs:
      - to: 'engineering-oncall@company.com'
        subject: '🚨 CRITICAL: Phoenix MLS Alert'
        html: |
          <h3>Alert: {{ .GroupLabels.alertname }}</h3>
          <p>Severity: {{ .GroupLabels.severity }}</p>
          <!-- More HTML content -->
```

#### 1.2 Service Startup Orchestration
```yaml
# Optimized startup sequence
depends_on:
  prometheus:
    condition: service_healthy
  mongodb:
    condition: service_healthy
  ollama:
    condition: service_started
```

#### 1.3 Network Isolation Strategy
- **monitoring**: Dedicated network for Prometheus/Grafana/AlertManager
- **app**: Application services (Phoenix App, MongoDB, Ollama)
- **proxy**: External-facing services (Nginx)

### Phase 2: Production Hardening (Days 3-5)

#### 2.1 Container Orchestration Improvements
```yaml
# Production-ready compose structure
services:
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "wget", "--spider", "http://localhost:9090/-/healthy"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 2G
          cpus: '1.0'
        reservations:
          memory: 1G
          cpus: '0.5'
```

#### 2.2 Security Enhancements
- SSL termination at Nginx proxy
- Service mesh with mTLS
- Secrets management via environment variables
- Network policies restricting inter-service communication

### Phase 3: Scalability Optimization (Days 6-8)

#### 3.1 Multi-Market Expansion Architecture

**Current State**: Single Phoenix market
**Target State**: 10+ markets (Phoenix, Scottsdale, Tempe, Mesa, etc.)

```yaml
# Market-specific scaling strategy
deployment:
  strategy: horizontal_pod_autoscaling
  metrics:
    - market_load: 70%
    - response_time: 5s
    - memory_usage: 80%
  
  market_configs:
    phoenix:
      replicas: 3
      resources: { cpu: 1, memory: 2Gi }
    scottsdale:
      replicas: 2
      resources: { cpu: 0.5, memory: 1Gi }
```

#### 3.2 Resource Requirements Analysis

| Component | Current | 5 Markets | 10 Markets | 20 Markets |
|-----------|---------|-----------|------------|------------|
| **App Instances** | 1 | 3 | 6 | 12 |
| **Memory Total** | 4GB | 12GB | 24GB | 48GB |
| **CPU Cores** | 2 | 6 | 12 | 24 |
| **Storage** | 100GB | 500GB | 1TB | 2TB |
| **Monthly Cost** | $150 | $450 | $900 | $1,800 |

### Phase 4: Monitoring Excellence (Days 9-10)

#### 4.1 Comprehensive Monitoring Stack

**Service Health Monitoring**:
- **Application**: Phoenix Real Estate metrics exporter
- **Infrastructure**: Node Exporter, cAdvisor
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas monitoring integration
- **LLM**: Ollama performance metrics
- **Logs**: Loki aggregation with structured logging

**Key Performance Indicators**:
```yaml
sla_targets:
  availability: 99.5%
  response_time_p95: 5s
  error_rate: <1%
  data_freshness: <6h
```

#### 4.2 Alert Strategy Optimization

**Alert Tiers**:
- **Critical**: Service down, data loss risk (immediate notification)
- **Warning**: Performance degradation (4-hour escalation)
- **Info**: Capacity planning, trends (daily digest)

**Notification Channels**:
- Slack integration for engineering team
- PagerDuty for critical alerts
- Email summaries for stakeholders
