## Security Assessment

### Current Security Posture: **6.0/10** (Needs Improvement)

**Implemented Security Measures:**
- ✅ Local LLM processing (no data leaves localhost)
- ✅ HTTP client timeout configurations
- ✅ Connection pooling with limits
- ✅ Structured error handling without sensitive data exposure

**Security Gaps Identified:**
- ❌ **Prompt Injection Vulnerability**: No validation of user input to LLM prompts
- ❌ **Resource Exhaustion**: Missing memory limits for LLM processing
- ❌ **Data Sanitization**: Property data not sanitized before LLM processing
- ❌ **Audit Logging**: No security event logging for suspicious activities

**Critical Security Recommendations:**
1. Implement prompt sanitization to prevent injection attacks
2. Add memory and CPU resource limits for LLM operations
3. Sanitize extracted property data before database storage
4. Add security audit logging for failed authentications and unusual patterns
