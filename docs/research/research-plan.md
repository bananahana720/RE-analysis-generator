# Research Plan: Agentic Real Estate Data Collection Workflow

## Project Overview
Building a recurring automated system to collect residential real estate data from various sources (web scraping/OCR/APIs) organized by zip codes, with extraction of key property attributes for decision-making support.

## Research Approach
Deploying 5 specialized research assistants to investigate different aspects of this complex project in parallel.

## Research Assistant Assignments

### RA-1: Data Sources & API Expert
**Role**: Real Estate Data Acquisition Specialist  
**Focus Question**: "What are the best methods, APIs, and data sources for automated real estate data collection, including MLS access, public APIs (Zillow, Redfin, Realtor.com), web scraping techniques, and OCR solutions for property listings?"

**Key Research Areas**:
- Available real estate APIs (pricing, rate limits, data coverage)
- Web scraping tools and frameworks for real estate sites
- OCR solutions for image-based listings
- Data quality and completeness comparison
- Alternative data sources (county records, tax assessments)

### RA-2: Technical Architecture Specialist
**Role**: Workflow Automation Engineer  
**Focus Question**: "How should we architect a scalable, recurring workflow system for real estate data collection that handles scheduling, error recovery, rate limiting, and distributed processing across multiple zip codes?"

**Key Research Areas**:
- Workflow orchestration tools (Airflow, Prefect, Temporal)
- Scheduling and cron job management
- Error handling and retry strategies
- Scalability patterns for concurrent data collection
- Monitoring and alerting systems

### RA-3: Data Engineering Expert
**Role**: Database Architecture Specialist  
**Focus Question**: "What database design patterns and technologies are optimal for storing semi-structured real estate data with fields like price, square footage, amenities, and location data, considering both query performance and flexibility?"

**Key Research Areas**:
- SQL vs NoSQL for real estate data
- Schema design for property attributes
- Handling variable/optional fields
- Time-series aspects (price history)
- Geospatial indexing for location queries
- Data versioning and change tracking

### RA-4: Legal & Compliance Analyst
**Role**: Data Collection Ethics Specialist  
**Focus Question**: "What are the legal considerations, terms of service constraints, and ethical guidelines for automated real estate data collection, including website scraping policies, data usage rights, and privacy concerns?"

**Key Research Areas**:
- Website terms of service analysis
- Legal frameworks for web scraping
- Data privacy regulations (CCPA, GDPR implications)
- Fair use and public data considerations
- Best practices for ethical data collection
- Robots.txt compliance

### RA-5: Feature Enhancement Specialist
**Role**: Real Estate Analytics Expert  
**Focus Question**: "Beyond basic property attributes, what additional data points and analytical features would enhance a real estate decision-making system, including market trends, neighborhood analysis, and predictive indicators?"

**Key Research Areas**:
- Additional valuable data points (schools, crime, walkability)
- Market trend indicators
- Comparative market analysis features
- ML/AI integration possibilities
- Visualization and reporting needs
- Integration with external services (mapping, demographics)

## Expected Deliverables
1. Individual research reports (500-1000 words each)
2. Comprehensive synthesis covering:
   - Recommended technology stack
   - System architecture design
   - Database schema recommendations
   - Legal compliance checklist
   - Implementation roadmap
   - Cost estimates and resource requirements

## Timeline
- Research Phase: Parallel execution across all assistants
- Synthesis Phase: Integration of findings into actionable recommendations
