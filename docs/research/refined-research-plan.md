# Refined Research Plan: Personal Real Estate Data Collection System (2025)

## Updated Project Context
Based on key considerations, this is a **personal use** project with strict budget constraints ($25/month max) focusing on Phoenix, Arizona real estate data for home buying decisions.

## Revised Research Approach
Deploying 4 specialized research assistants to investigate budget-friendly, personal-use solutions available in 2025.

## Research Assistant Assignments

### RA-1: Budget-Friendly Data Access Specialist
**Role**: Personal Use Data Solutions Expert  
**Focus Question**: "What are the most cost-effective data access methods in 2025 for personal real estate research, including free APIs, MLS workarounds, recently sold property sources, and modern scraping solutions that stay within a $25/month budget?"

**Key Research Areas**:
- Free and low-cost API solutions available in 2025
- MLS access alternatives for individuals
- Recently sold property data sources (< 1 year)
- Modern scraping libraries with anti-detection
- MCP servers and LLM-based extraction tools
- Budget breakdown for $25/month constraint

### RA-2: Minimal Infrastructure Architect
**Role**: Cost-Optimized Systems Engineer  
**Focus Question**: "How can we build a daily automated real estate data collection system in 2025 using minimal infrastructure, local LLMs, and staying within $25/month for proxy services and storage?"

**Key Research Areas**:
- Local LLM solutions for data extraction (2025 models)
- Free/cheap workflow orchestration for daily runs
- NoSQL database options for semi-structured data
- Cost-effective proxy rotation services
- Minimal infrastructure patterns
- Docker/container-based personal deployments

### RA-3: Phoenix Market Intelligence Expert
**Role**: Arizona Real Estate Specialist  
**Focus Question**: "What are the specific characteristics, data sources, and market dynamics of Phoenix real estate in 2025, focusing on 2-3 initial zip codes for MVP implementation?"

- 2025 scraping detection technologies
- Modern anti-detection libraries and tools
- Gradual implementation strategies
- Risk assessment for various sources
- Transformative use considerations

## Expected Deliverables
1. Individual research reports (500-1000 words each)
2. Refined comprehensive analysis including:
   - Budget-optimized technology stack
   - Phoenix-specific implementation plan
   - Personal use compliance strategy
   - MVP roadmap for 2-3 zip codes
   - Monthly cost breakdown staying under $25

## Research Constraints
- Focus on 2025 technologies and solutions
- Personal use only (no commercial considerations)
- Maximum $25/month budget
- Phoenix, Arizona specific
- Preference for API access over scraping
- Local LLM usage (no proprietary API costs)
