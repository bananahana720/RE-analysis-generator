  - health_checks: System status and availability
  - api_monitoring: External API responsiveness
  - data_quality: Collection pipeline validation

- **Daily** (Scheduled times UTC):
  - performance_regression: 00:00 UTC daily
  - security_scan: 01:00 UTC daily
  - cost_analysis: 02:00 UTC daily

- **Weekly**:
  - comprehensive_e2e: Sunday 03:00 UTC
  - dependency_updates: Tuesday 04:00 UTC
  - disaster_recovery: Friday 05:00 UTC

- **Monthly**:
  - security_audit: 1st of month
  - performance_optimization: 15th of month
  - infrastructure_review: Last day of month

## 3.2 Performance Regression Testing

**Objective**: Continuous performance monitoring and optimization

### Performance Monitoring Framework
- **Key Metrics**:
  - api_response_time: Target <200ms, Alert >500ms
  - llm_processing_time: Target <30s, Alert >60s
  - database_query_time: Target <100ms, Alert >200ms
  - memory_usage: Target <400MB, Alert >480MB

- **Trend Analysis**:
  - response_time_trends: 7-day and 30-day moving averages
  - error_rate_patterns: Anomaly detection and alerting
  - resource_utilization: Growth trending and capacity planning

- **Optimization Triggers**:
  - performance_degradation: >15% increase in response times
  - resource_pressure: >80% memory utilization sustained
  - cost_efficiency: >$20/month budget utilization

## 3.3 Data Quality Validation Testing

**Objective**: Continuous data integrity and quality assurance

### Data Quality Framework
- **Extraction Accuracy**:
  - property_details: Required fields presence validation
  - data_consistency: Cross-source data correlation
  - format_validation: Data type and format compliance

- **Processing Quality**:
  - llm_extraction: LLM output quality scoring
  - duplicate_detection: Duplicate property identification
  - data_enrichment: Additional data source integration

- **Storage Integrity**:
  - database_consistency: ACID compliance validation
  - backup_verification: Backup completeness and recoverability
  - historical_preservation: Long-term data retention validation

## 3.4 Cost Optimization Validation

**Objective**: Continuous cost monitoring and optimization

### Cost Monitoring Framework
- **Budget Tracking**:
  - api_usage_costs: Maricopa API, WebShare, 2captcha usage
  - infrastructure_costs: Server, database, storage costs
  - monitoring_costs: Logging, metrics, alerting infrastructure

- **Efficiency Metrics**:
  - cost_per_property: Total cost / properties collected
  - api_efficiency: Successful requests / total API calls
  - resource_utilization: Cost / utilized resources ratio

- **Optimization Opportunities**:
  - api_rate_optimization: Request timing and batching optimization
  - cache_effectiveness: Cache hit rates and memory efficiency
  - resource_scaling: Dynamic resource allocation based on load

## 3.5 Service Health Monitoring and Testing

**Objective**: Proactive monitoring of all system components

### Health Monitoring Framework
- **Service Availability**:
  - mongodb_health: Connection pool status, query performance
  - ollama_health: Model availability, response quality
  - api_endpoints_health: External API accessibility and rate limits
  - proxy_health: IP rotation, anonymization effectiveness

- **Performance Health**:
  - response_time_monitoring: Real-time API response tracking
  - throughput_monitoring: Requests processed per minute
  - error_rate_monitoring: Failed requests and error patterns
  - resource_health: CPU, memory, disk, network utilization

- **Business Logic Health**:
  - collection_success_rate: Properties successfully collected
  - processing_accuracy: LLM extraction quality metrics
  - data_completeness: Required fields population rates
  - workflow_efficiency: End-to-end pipeline performance

**Alert Thresholds**:
- Critical: Service unavailable, >10% error rate, >$25/day cost
- Warning: >5% error rate, >500ms response time, >80% resource usage
- Info: Performance trends, optimization opportunities, maintenance windows
