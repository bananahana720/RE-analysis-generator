# Production Restoration Execution Checklist

## CRITICAL - System Down 2+ Days

### Pre-Execution Requirements

#### ✅ Environment Setup
- [ ] `.env` file created from `.env.sample`
- [ ] All required secrets configured
- [ ] GitHub repository secrets updated
- [ ] MongoDB service running
- [ ] Ollama service running

#### ✅ Dependencies
- [ ] `uv sync` completed successfully
- [ ] All Python packages installed
- [ ] Database connection verified
- [ ] External APIs accessible

### Execution Steps

#### Step 1: Quick Secret Validation
```bash
# Validate secrets configuration
python scripts/validation/validate_secrets.py validate
```

#### Step 2: Run Full Production Restoration Test
```bash
# Execute complete validation suite
python scripts/testing/production/production_restoration_validator.py --full
```

#### Step 3: Performance Validation
```bash
# Validate performance benchmarks
python scripts/testing/production/performance_validator.py --performance
```

#### Step 4: Complete Test Suite
```bash
# Run all tests together
./scripts/testing/production/run_production_restoration_tests.sh
```

### Success Criteria

#### ✅ All Tests Must Pass
- [ ] Secrets validation: PASS
- [ ] Database connectivity: PASS  
- [ ] External services: PASS
- [ ] Performance benchmarks: PASS
- [ ] Data quality metrics: PASS

#### ✅ Performance Targets Met
- [ ] Database connection < 5s
- [ ] API responses < 10s
- [ ] LLM processing < 30s
- [ ] Data accuracy > 85%

### Emergency Procedures

#### If Tests Fail
```bash
# Execute emergency rollback
python scripts/testing/production/emergency_rollback.py --execute
```

#### If System Unstable
1. Stop all data collection processes
2. Isolate affected workflows
3. Revert to last known good configuration
4. Notify stakeholders immediately

### Post-Restoration Actions

#### ✅ Immediate (0-1 hour)
- [ ] Monitor system stability
- [ ] Verify data collection workflows
- [ ] Test end-to-end functionality
- [ ] Check error rates < 1%

#### ✅ Short-term (1-24 hours)
- [ ] Performance monitoring active
- [ ] Alert systems functional
- [ ] Data quality validation
- [ ] Full workload testing

#### ✅ Follow-up (24+ hours)
- [ ] Post-mortem analysis
- [ ] Process improvements
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] Team debriefing

### Important Notes

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: System has been DOWN for 2+ days
🚨 **PRIORITY**: Every minute of downtime has business impact
🔧 **APPROACH**: Systematic validation before declaring success
📊 **EVIDENCE**: All decisions must be data-driven
🔄 **FALLBACK**: Rollback procedures ready if validation fails

---

**Remember**: Do not declare production restoration successful until ALL validation tests pass and system stability is confirmed.
