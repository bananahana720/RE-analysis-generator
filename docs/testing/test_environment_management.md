# Test Environment Management Strategy

## 6.1 Production-Like Test Environment Setup

### Environment Specification
- **Staging Environment**:
  - Infrastructure:
    - mongodb: 8.1.2 with replica set configuration
    - ollama: llama3.2:latest model with production memory limits
    - proxies: WebShare proxy pool with rotation
    - monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana stack
  
  - Configuration:
    - secrets: Test API keys with production-like rate limits
    - database: Sanitized production data subset
    - networking: Production-equivalent network configuration

- **Performance Testing Environment**:
  - Resources:
    - cpu: Production-equivalent CPU allocation
    - memory: 512MB limit matching production
    - storage: SSD storage with production IOPS
    - network: Bandwidth matching production environment

## 6.2 Test Data Management and Privacy

### Test Data Strategy
- **Data Sources**:
  - synthetic_data: AI-generated property data for testing
  - anonymized_production: Sanitized production data subset
  - fixture_data: Curated test scenarios and edge cases

- **Privacy Compliance**:
  - data_anonymization: PII removal and obfuscation
  - gdpr_compliance: Data retention and deletion policies
  - access_control: Role-based test data access

- **Data Lifecycle**:
  - generation: Automated test data generation
  - refreshment: Weekly test data refresh cycle
  - cleanup: Automated test data cleanup after execution

## 6.3 Environment Provisioning and Teardown

### Infrastructure as Code
- **Environment Provisioning**:
  - automated_setup: Script-based environment provisioning
  - configuration_management: Version-controlled environment configs
  - dependency_management: Automated service dependency setup

- **Teardown Procedures**:
  - resource_cleanup: Automated resource deallocation
  - data_cleanup: Complete test data removal
  - cost_optimization: Immediate resource teardown post-testing

## 6.4 Cross-Environment Consistency Validation

### Environment Consistency Framework
- **Infrastructure Parity**:
  - version_matching: Software versions across environments
  - configuration_sync: Config file consistency validation
  - dependency_alignment: Package version synchronization

- **Data Consistency**:
  - schema_validation: Database schema consistency
  - seed_data: Consistent baseline data across environments
  - migration_testing: Data migration testing in staging

- **Monitoring Parity**:
  - metrics_collection: Identical monitoring setup
  - alerting_rules: Consistent alerting configuration
  - dashboard_setup: Unified monitoring dashboards

## 6.5 Environment Access Control and Security

### Security Framework
- **Access Management**:
  - role_based_access: Developer, tester, admin role separation
  - temporary_access: Time-limited environment access tokens
  - audit_logging: Complete access audit trail

- **Network Security**:
  - network_isolation: Environment network segmentation
  - firewall_rules: Consistent security policies across environments
  - vpn_access: Secure remote access to test environments

- **Data Security**:
  - encryption_standards: Same encryption as production
  - backup_security: Encrypted and access-controlled backups
  - data_masking: Production data anonymization for testing
