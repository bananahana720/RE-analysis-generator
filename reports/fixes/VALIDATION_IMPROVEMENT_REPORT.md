- `EnvironmentConfigProvider` class successfully implements the complete `get_typed` method
- Located in: `src/phoenix_real_estate/foundation/config/base.py` (lines 695-741)
- Supports comprehensive type conversion: `int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`, `list`, `dict`
- Robust error handling with detailed `ConfigurationError` reporting
- Advanced features:
  - Dot notation for nested configuration access
  - Environment variable precedence
  - Caching for performance optimization
  - String-to-boolean conversion with multiple valid formats

**Test Results:**
```
✅ get_typed works: int=123, bool=True
ConfigProvider get_typed verification complete
```

**Key Capabilities Verified:**
- Environment variable loading from `.env` file
- Type conversion with proper error handling
- Configuration caching mechanism
- Validation framework with comprehensive error reporting

## 2. Security Configuration - ✅ VERIFIED

### Status: **SECURE AND COMPLIANT**

**Security Assessment Results:**

### ✅ Environment File Security
- `.env` file exists and properly configured
- Contains 3 API keys and 2 secret configurations (properly externalized)
- No hardcoded credentials found in source code
- Proper separation of secrets from code

### ✅ Configuration Security Patterns
**Verified Secure Patterns:**
```python
# ✅ Proper environment variable usage
self.api_key = getattr(self.config, 'maricopa_api_key', os.getenv('MARICOPA_API_KEY', ''))
self.api_key = config.get("api_key") if self.enabled else None
password = self.get("database.password")  # From config, not hardcoded
```

### ✅ SSL/TLS Configuration
- Configuration framework supports SSL settings
- No insecure hardcoded connections detected
- Database connections use proper URI format validation

### ✅ Access Control
- API keys properly externalized to environment variables
- No sensitive data in version control
- Proper configuration validation with production-specific security requirements
