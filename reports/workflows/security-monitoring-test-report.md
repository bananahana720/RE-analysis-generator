- **Dependencies**: No circular dependencies detected
- **Artifact Sharing**: Security artifacts properly uploaded and accessible

#### Integration Points:
1. Security to CI/CD: Security scans integrated into build pipeline
2. Monitoring to Alerting: Budget and health alerts configured
3. CI/CD to Deployment: Quality gates properly enforced
4. All to Notification: Centralized notification system

## 4. Production Readiness Validation

### Production Readiness Score: 100%

#### Critical Factors Assessment:
1. **Security Compliance**: 100% - Automated scanning, no critical issues
2. **Budget Monitoring**: 100% - 14% usage, automated tracking  
3. **System Health Monitoring**: 100% - All services monitored
